      <description>Included in: VultMysteries  Anima is my own version of the sequence generator found on the PsychTone published on February 1971 in the Popular Electronics magazine. Anima provides all the features of the PsychTone except for the sound generator (which is very basic) and adds a few extra features including a Turing-Machine-like behavior.
Getting started Anima consists of a shift register working as pseudo random number generator algorithm. The fact that the shift register is short (6 stages) makes the sequences repeat periodically every 63 steps.</description>

      <guid>https://modlfo.github.io/VultModules/ferox/</guid>
      <description>Included in: VultModules  Ferox is based on the ingenious CMOS filter design. The CMOS filter uses an digital inverter chip to replace operational amplifiers. The result filter full of character, distorted and aggressive. Ferox can transform the simplest waveforms into completely new sound. In some cases it will make you doubt that it is a filter at all.
Documentation  Cutoff: this is the main knob in a filter. It defines the frequency at which the filter starts taking action.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultCompacts  The Freak! is a collection of all the Vult filters into a single module (in stereo). The Freak! is part of the Vult Compacts package.
The Freak! has advantages and disadvantages over the individual filters. For example, it can process signals in stereo, but lacks the flexibility of having the individual inputs and outputs of the different filter modes.

      <description>Vult is the side project of Dr. Leonardo Laguna Ruiz.
After more than 10 years developing scientific software, he decided to apply all his knowledge in electronics, mathematical modelling and simulation to his favorite hobby: Music Technology. ​
Currently, Leonardo still works developing the simulation core of Wolfram SystemModeler and runs Vult with the help of his family and friends.
​ Over the years, many people have helped with testing, design and ideas.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultModules VultModules Free  Caudal is a chaotic source that is based on the model of a multi segment pendulum (see the video below). The core of Caudal is a detailed simulation of the pendulum system from which we can get measurements like the angular velocities and positions of the segments. These measures produces very natural oscillations that are interrelated due to the nature of the system.
I made the original model using SystemModeler and later applied manual optimizations to improve the performance and being able of running it in real-time.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultMysteries  Dopamine is based on the idea that, every time we tell one of our memories our brain reconstructs the events rather than just recalling them. Our brain is an imperfect medium of storage where our memories can get confused or we can forget parts of the story.
Dopamine simulates this behavior by using different layers of virtual neurons. These neurons will try to store CV and Gate information and they will recall it as best as they can.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultModules VultModules Free  Julste is the only model that I haven&amp;rsquo;t developed by myself. When I started doing research on low pass gates I came across the paper &amp;ldquo;A DIGITAL MODEL OF THE BUCHLA LOWPASS-GATE&amp;rdquo; by Julian Parker and Stefano D’Angelo. They did all the hard job modeling it, and I rewrote the code in the Vult language and created the module.
The module has a few extensions to the original model, like controls to process the gate input.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultCompacts  Knock is a modern take on a classic analog bass drum. It features a hybrid engine capable producing a wide variety of drum sounds. The Stress input allows for further shaping of the sound by using a vactrol model to control the envelope.
Knock is split in two sections: the oscillator and noise synthesizers. The oscillator section is analog modeled while the noise is a special oscillator capable of producing many kinds of clicking sounds.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultModules VultModules Free  Nopskate is my take on the classic flip-flop octaver pedal but adapted to VCV Rack. Given any input signal, Nopskate will generate signals that are one and two octaves below the input signal. The generated signals can be added or multiplied (AM) to the original. These two ways of blending the generated signal can transform a simple input signal into a richer wave.
Nopskate is based on a circuit I made many years ago which was a failed attempt to clone the octaver guitar pedal.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultModules  Noxious is a digital oscillator and LFO based on Frequency and Phase modulation techniques. The idea for Noxious was to create an oscillator that captures the crazy and experimental nature of FM and PM but at the same time making easy to obtain usable results. Noxious can create from soft and cheesy sounds to very abrasive and distorted screams. In LFO mode can create quasi-chaotic signals.</description>

      <description>Included in: VultModules VultModules Free  Rescomb is a resonant Comb filter. A comb filter is a special kind of filter that creates multiple spaced notches. This module provides an CV input which is tuned (1V/octave) and a feedback parameter. when the feedback is high it will resonate enhancing the frequencies of the comb.
This is the first module that I designed for VCV Rack. I really like Comb filters, so I coded in Vult a very simple version after playing with it and tweaking parameters I got this version.</description>

I started developing the algorithms behind Trummor a long time ago and I made a simplified hardware version of it. When VCV Rack came out, I adapted the code and started expanding the sonic capabilities.
Trummor has been replaced by Trummor 2 which is an improved version with even more sonic capabilities.</description>

&amp;ldquo;a powerhouse of drum sounds. FM drums, metalic claps, analog-style kicks, all sorts of resonated karplus-strong style strings, blips and blops.</description>

With Unstabile remade the model and introduced nonlinearities that can occur when the circuit is fed with low voltage. The result is Unstabile a filter that makes everything sound big and distorted&amp;hellip; and it can self-oscillate.</description>
