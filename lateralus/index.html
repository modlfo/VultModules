<p>Lateralus is ladder filter which is the same structure that a very famous inventor created for his synthesizers. Lateralus is a detailed simulation model based on my own diode ladder filter.</p>
<p>The paid version of Lateralus has two implementations. Each implementation is based on a different simulation model that I have developed.</p>
<p>Some of the &ldquo;weird&rdquo; behaviors of the real filter were intentionally not reproduced in order to bring a more controllable filter. For example: large changes in gain with the resonance equals zero or with the cutoff completely open.</p>
<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cutoff</strong>: this is the main knob in a filter. It defines the frequency at which the filter starts taking action. Full left, the filter is completely closed. Full right it&rsquo;s open and should not have effect. The cutoff frequency can be controlled with a 1V/Oct signal through the included attenuverter.</li>
<li><strong>Resonance</strong>: the resonance boost the frequencies near the cutoff frequency. Increase this knob and you will hear the personality of the filter. After some point the filter will start self-oscillating and can be used as a sound generator.</li>
<li><strong>Drive</strong>: controls the amount of signal that enters to the filter. Increasing the drive will cause the filter to saturate which adds interesting harmonics to the sound.</li>
<li><strong>Model</strong>: (Premium version only)
<ul>
<li><strong>DF</strong>: this model is the diode based version of the circuit. It provides a smoother sound.</li>
<li><strong>TH</strong>: This is an alternative model that follows the same ladder architecture but provides more harsh sounds when distorting.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Outputs</strong>: The outputs of Lateralus provide different slopes:
<ul>
<li><strong>24 dB</strong>: This is the classical sound of this filter. But if you are adventurous you should try the other outputs.</li>
<li><strong>18 dB</strong>: This kind of filter was used by a famous acid box. Use this output and some drive to get some nice distorted sounds.</li>
<li><strong>12 dB</strong>: This output provides some nice attenuation. This would be similar to what you&rsquo;ll find in a state variable filter.</li>
<li><strong>6 dB</strong>: This may not be much filtering but it adds a very special character to the input signal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Input</strong>: You may provide an input signal to be filtered, but only if you want to. If not, just crack up the resonance and the filter will self-oscillate.</li>
</ul>
